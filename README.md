Vitalik Notes (Alpha)
The Ethereum layer 2 ecosystem has been expanding rapidly over the last year. The EVM rollup ecosystem, traditionally featuring Arbitrum, Optimism and Scroll, and more recently Kakarot and Taiko, has been progressing quickly, making great strides on improving their security; the L2beat page does a good job of summarizing the state of each project. Additionally, we have seen teams building sidechains also starting to build rollups (Polygon), layer 1 projects seeking to move toward being validiums (Celo), and totally new efforts (Linea, Zeth...). Finally, there is the not-just-EVM ecosystem: "almost-EVMs" like Zksync, extensions like Arbitrum Stylus, and broader efforts like the Starknet ecosystem, Fuel and others.

the Intmax approach, which involves putting a few bytes on chain rollup-style together with a Plasma-like operator that passes around information between individual users.
